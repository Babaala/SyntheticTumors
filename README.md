# Synthetic Tumors Make AI Segment Tumors Better

This repository provides extensive examples of synthetic liver tumors generated by our novel strategies. Check to see if you could tell which is real tumor and which is synthetic tumor. More importantly, our synthetic tumors can be used for training AI models, and have proven to achieve a similar performance in real tumor segmentation. 

**Amazing**, right?
